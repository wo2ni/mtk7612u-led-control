# Disable usb scatter-gather support
#
# Scatter-Gather options: ( disable_usb_sg )
#
# 0 = disable_usb_sg (scatter-gather is on)  (module default)
# 1 = disable_usb_sg (scatter-gather is off) (this script default)
#
# Information about the Scatter-Gather module parameter:
#
# Background: Scatter and Gather (Vectored I/O) is a concept that was primarily
# used in hard disks and it enhances large I/O request performance.
#
# Problem reports seem to be limited to situations where the user is running an
# AP with a USB3 capable adapter in a USB3 port while operating on the 5Ghz
# band. Symtoms include dramatically reduced throughput. Research tends to
# indicate that this could be a hardware specific problem and is not caused by
# the driver or USB WiFi adapter.
